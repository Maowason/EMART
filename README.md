[Link to the website](http://emartbymao.000webhostapp.com/">http://emartbymao.000webhostapp.com)

The website starts with a Login Page:  
|  Field   |    Input     |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Username |  testuser    |
| Password | testuserpass |

enter the details as given, hit login and voila! We are in our shopping mart.  
Now in EMART we can 'Add to Cart' all the items that we require. Adding the same item multiple times is not allowed.  
Now we can hit the down arrow to go to the bottom of our page and check the Cart. The Cart shows the item with the images, their price and also the quantity.  
Yes, Now this is where you can either increase the quantity of a certain item, decrease it or completely delete it from the Cart. The Total Cost will change accordingly.  
Theres now a button 'Print Invoice' which will let you print an invoice of all the cart items and the Total Payable Amount, this can then be saved as a PDF.  
Now we can finally hit the BUY button at the very bottom which will first return a message to the user "Thank you for your purchase! Clearing Cart...", it will then Clear Up the Cart  
The navbar has 2 more options apart from Shop, Logout and Contact.  
Logout will lead us to the login page again and Contact will take us to the About Us page which currently has a Lorem Ipsum  text on it.  
So thats it for how we operate the entire application.
